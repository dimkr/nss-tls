Package: nss-tlsd
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: foreign
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: encrypted DNS name resolution daemon
 nss-tls is an alternative, encrypted name resolving library to use
 with glibc, which uses DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH).
 .
 The glibc name resolver can be configured through nsswitch.conf(5) to
 use nss-tls instead of the DNS resolver, or fall back to DNS when
 nss-tls fails.
 .
 This way, all applications that use the standard resolver API
 (getaddrinfo(), gethostbyname(), etc'), are transparently migrated
 from DNS to encrypted means of name resolving, with zero
 application-side changes and minimal resource consumption footprint.
 However, nss-tls does not deal with applications that use their own,
 built-in DNS resolver.
 .
 This package contains the daemon to be used in conjunction with the
 libnss-tls NSS module. The daemon runs in the background, receives
 name resolving requests over a Unix socket and replies with resolved
 addresses.

 .
 This package contains the NSS module, a tiny client library, which
 delegates the resolving work to nss-tlsd through the Unix socket and
 passes the results back to the application, without dependencies
 other than libc.
